This project is a web app that redesigns Occidental College's [Course Counts](http://counts.oxy.edu/) with a friendlier user interface that simultaneously offers more flexibility. The long-term goal is to supersede Course Counts by serving all student-side course scheduling needs, including graduation and major/minor planning.

The live app can be found at [http://subitize.herokuapp.com/](http://subitize.herokuapp.com/).

## Running Locally

This app requires Python 3. The following will host a local clone of the site:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/justinnhli/subitize.git subitize
cd subitize
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 subitize-app.py
```
